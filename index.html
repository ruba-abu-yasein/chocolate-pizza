        <p>Preheat oven to 450°. Sprinkle about half the sugar onto a clean surface. Place pizza dough on sugar and spread remaining sugar on top. Roll pizza dough out into an 11" circle. 
            Transfer dough to a large baking sheet and poke all over with a fork, then brush with melted butter. Bake until golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool slightly. 
            Spread Nutella all over crust, leaving a 1" border around the edge. Top with chopped Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, Reese’s Pieces, and peanuts. Serve warm.
